# Signup Genius Landing Page

This repository contains a modern, sleek static landing page inspired by signup workflow tools.

## Preview

Open `index.html` in a browser or run a quick local server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/index.html` to view the page.

## Run in the cloud

If you are using a cloud workspace or remote container, start the server on all
interfaces so your forwarded port can access it:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000 --bind 0.0.0.0
```

Then open the forwarded URL for port 8000 in your cloud environment.
